  Boycott - A Gatsby Boycott Template
</h1>

Boycott is a powerful and customizable template for creating boycott websites, built with React and Gatsby. Inspired by the design and functionality of [BoycotZionism](https://www.boycotzionism.com/), this template provides a solid foundation for launching your own boycott campaigns quickly and effectively.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Boycott site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the Boycott template.

    ```shell
    gatsby new my-boycott-site https://github.com/errhythm/gatsby-boycott-template
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-boycott-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!
